## 📈 Understanding RFM Analysis

RFM analysis focuses on three key aspects:

- **Frequency:** How often a customer makes a purchase within a specific time frame.
- **Monetary:** How much money a customer spends.

By assessing these metrics, you can identify valuable customer segments. For instance:
- **Champions:** Customers who buy frequently and have high spending.
- **Loyal Customers:** Who buy often with moderate spending.
- **At Risk:** Customers who used to buy frequently but haven't purchased recently.
- **Hibernating:** Customers who haven’t made a purchase in a long time.

## 🎨 Visualizations

The application generates several types of visualizations to clearly display your customer segments. Here are the common types:

- **Bar Charts:** Show the distribution of different segments.
- **Heatmaps:** Indicate activity levels among customer groups.
- **Pie Charts:** Provide a clear overview of segment sizes.
